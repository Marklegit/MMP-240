   <p class="test1"> I was sitting on the train waiting while heading home. i heard to my left the door open. When a man transfered from a different cart i was shocked. Not because the man did something illegal but because his face was just hard to regnize. he had little human characteristics on his face. He was standing around 10 feet away from my eyes and His face looked burnt. It Then made me feel sprry becuase he asked for money on the train and left after that. </p>
