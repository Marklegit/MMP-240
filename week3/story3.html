   <p class="test1"> I'm in my Eng 101 class, students are picking handout papers which is a dialy thing. But for some reason my professor had a bad day and in the middle of this section she just snatch a student's paper and said "I'm still putting papers on the table." I thought that was very rude and it felt like a highschool class. Also she didn't put any others papers after so... that was uncall for.</p>
