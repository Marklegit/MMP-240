    <h2>Man Mauled By Tiger...</h2>

   <p class="test1"> A man was mauled by a tiger after jumping over a fence. The enclosure had 4 tigers. And while they played with him out of curiousity, one of the tiger quickly got rough and possessive. The tiger grab the man by the neck after thrashing him for a bit. The police tried to save the man with a fire crackers. 3 tigers moved away but that 1 tiger didn't let go of the man. I would say it became aggressive and didn't want to give its prey. The man died after this event and the tiger was shot dead. </p>
